        H1: The Q3 2023 UI overhaul caused satisfaction decline
        - Evidence for: Timing aligns with NPS drop, support tickets mention "confusing new interface"
        - Evidence against: Competitor launched aggressive campaign at same time

        H2: Implementation speed advantage is eroding as we scale
        - Evidence for: Recent implementations taking 4-5 months vs. 3 months previously
        - Evidence against: Still much faster than competitors

        H3: Integration limitations are becoming deal-breakers
        - Evidence for: Lost 3 deals in Q1 specifically citing integration requirements
        - Evidence against: Integration roadmap is robust, releases planned Q2-Q3

        H4: Customer support responsiveness is the primary driver
        - Evidence for: Support ticket volume and resolution times correlating with satisfaction decline
        - Evidence against: Customer success team size grew 40%, so capacity isn't the issue

                            <h4>Complete Context Example</h4>
                            <div class="code-block">
        <strong>COMPREHENSIVE CONTEXT STATEMENT:</strong>

        You are designing a customer satisfaction survey for CloudCare EHR, a B2B SaaS company providing 
        electronic health records to mid-size hospitals (200-500 beds). We're #4 in market share (8%) 
        competing against three larger players with a "modern, cloud-native" positioning.

        <strong>Business Problem:</strong> Renewal rates dropped from 92% to 87% over 6 months. Leadership needs to 
        decide whether to invest $2M in customer support expansion or product development. Decision at 
        board meeting June 15th.

        <strong>Target Audience:</strong> Hospital IT Directors/CIOs (85% male, ages 42-58, master's+, risk-averse, 
        budget-conscious, very limited time). They care most about uptime, compliance, and minimizing 
        staff complaints.

        <strong>Historical Context:</strong> NPS declined from 52 to 42 over 12 months. Major UI overhaul Q3 2023 
        received mixed feedback. Support tickets up 35% YoY, resolution time increased from 1.8 to 
        3.2 days. Main competitor launched aggressive pricing campaign.

        <strong>Competitive Position:</strong> Fastest implementation (3 months vs. 12-18 for competitors), $100K less 
        per year, but fewer integrations and smaller partner ecosystem.

        <strong>Project Constraints:</strong> $15K budget, 6-week timeline, need 400 responses from 1,200 customers, 
        survey MUST complete in under 7 minutes, must work on mobile (60% of responses), HIPAA compliant 
        platform required.

        <strong>Key Hypotheses to Test:</strong>
        1. UI overhaul caused satisfaction decline
        2. Implementation speed advantage eroding as we scale
        3. Integration limitations becoming deal-breakers  
        4. Support responsiveness is primary driver of decline

        Scale: 1-Very Dissatisfied, 2-Dissatisfied, 3-Somewhat Dissatisfied, 4-Neutral, 5-Somewhat Satisfied, 6-Satisfied, 7-Very Satisfied
        Logic: If Q7 ≤ 3 (dissatisfied), skip to Q8 (support pain points). If Q7 ≥ 5, skip to Q10 (feature satisfaction)
        Note: Tests H4 (support responsiveness driving satisfaction decline). Response time increased from 1.8 to 3.2 days - this should surface whether it's impacting satisfaction.

                            <div class="code-block">
        <strong>THEME 1:</strong> Customer Support Response Time (Mentioned by 347/400 respondents, 87%, CRITICAL priority)

        <strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
        - Average satisfaction with support response time: 3.2/7 (down from 5.8/7 six months ago)
        - "It takes 3-4 days to get a response on critical issues. That's unacceptable." - Respondent #127 (Large Hospital, 3-year customer)
        - "We've had tickets sit for a week with no updates. I have to call my account manager just to get status." - Respondent #201 (Mid-size Hospital, 2-year customer)
        - 89% of detractors (NPS 0-6) cited slow support vs. only 12% of promoters (NPS 9-10)
        - Correlation analysis: Each additional day in average response time = -5.3 NPS points (r=-0.73, p<0.001)

        <strong>BUSINESS IMPACT:</strong>
        - Directly driving renewal decline: customers citing support as primary reason for non-renewal increased from 8% to 31%
        - Estimated revenue at risk: $2.4M annually if current trend continues
        - Competitive vulnerability: Epic's average response time is 18 hours - we've gone from beating them to being 4x slower
        - Churn predictor: Customers with 3+ slow support experiences have 67% renewal rate vs. 94% for those with fast support

        <strong>ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:</strong>
        - Customer base grew 40% but support team only grew 15% - capacity insufficient
        - New tier-2 support hires are undertrained, leading to ticket reassignments and delays
        - Ticket prioritization system not working - non-urgent tickets getting same treatment as critical
        - Knowledge base outdated after Q3 UI overhaul - support can't find answers quickly

        <strong>RECOMMENDATIONS:</strong>

        <strong>Immediate (0-30 days):</strong>
        1. Implement tiered SLA system: P1 (critical) = 2 hours, P2 (high) = 8 hours, P3 (normal) = 24 hours, P4 (low) = 48 hours
        Owner: VP Customer Success | Investment: $0 (process change)
        2. Hire 3 experienced support engineers (not junior) to handle tier-2 escalations
        Owner: VP Customer Success | Investment: $450K annually | Expected impact: -20% average response time
        3. Update knowledge base with Q3 UI changes and new common issues
        Owner: Support Manager + Product Marketing | Investment: 40 hours | Completion: Week of May 15

        <strong>Short-term (30-90 days):</strong>
        4. Launch comprehensive tier-2 training program with certification requirement
        Owner: Support Manager | Investment: $75K | Expected impact: -30% ticket reassignment rate
        5. Implement customer-facing ticket status dashboard for transparency
        Owner: Engineering | Investment: 2 sprint cycles | Expected impact: -50% "status check" calls

        <strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong>
        - Average response time: 3.2 days → 18 hours (80% improvement) within 90 days
        - NPS improvement: +12 points (from 42 to 54) based on correlation analysis
        - Churn reduction: 13% → 9% (estimated $1.8M revenue retention)
        - ROI: Positive within 6 months (investment $525K, retention benefit $1.8M)

        <strong>CONFIDENCE LEVEL:</strong> HIGH
        - Large sample size (347/400 = 87% of respondents)
        - Strong statistical correlations (r=-0.73, p<0.001)
        - Triangulated with renewal data, support ticket metrics, and competitor benchmarks
        - Consistent across all customer segments (no contradictory data)

        "Customer research reveals a fixable problem. Our NPS of 42 trails industry leader (61) primarily due to support response times (3.2 days vs. 18 hours). This is a capacity issue, not a product issue - we grew customers 40% but support only 15%. Management recommends $2M support investment to reduce churn from 13% to 9%, protecting $1.8M in annual recurring revenue. ROI positive within 6 months. Risk if we don't act: further market share losses to competitors who are investing heavily in customer success.

        <strong>ROUND 2 - Add Critical Context:</strong>
        "Revise these questions to specifically address: (1) support response times, (2) UI usability after 
        Q3 overhaul, (3) implementation experience, (4) integration capabilities. Also add customer segment

        <strong>ROUND 3 - Fix Specific Issues:</strong>
        "Problems to fix:
        - Question 3 uses leading language ('our excellent support') - rewrite neutrally

        - Question 12 is too long (78 characters) - shorten to under 60 for mobile
        - Questions 14-15 (demographics) should move to the end
        - Missing NPS question - add in standard format"
        [Review for quality improvements]

        <strong>ROUND 4 - Optimize for Constraints:</strong>
        "Verify survey meets these requirements:
        - Total time: 5-7 minutes (currently 8 - need to cut)
        - Reading level: Grade 8 (questions 4, 9, 13 are too complex - simplify)
        - Mobile friendly: All questions under 60 characters
        - Include progress indicators: Group into 3 sections with clear labels

        Make necessary adjustments to meet all constraints."

        "Final review checklist:
        - Are instructions clear for every question?
        - Is skip logic properly defined?
        - Are response options balanced and mutually exclusive?

        <strong>EXAMPLE 1 - GOOD INSIGHT:</strong>

        <strong>FINDING:</strong> Implementation timeline is our strongest competitive advantage
        <strong>EVIDENCE:</strong> 
        - 78% of customers cited 'fast implementation' as primary reason for choosing us
        - Our average: 3 months vs. Epic: 16 months, Cerner: 14 months
        - Every month saved in implementation = +8 NPS points (r=0.81)
        <strong>SO WHAT:</strong> 
        - This is our #1 differentiator - protect it as we scale
        - Current trend concerning: Implementation time increased from 3 to 4.2 months as customer base grew
        - Action: Cap implementation team size per project at 80% of capacity to maintain speed
        <strong>CONFIDENCE:</strong> High (large sample, strong correlation, validated with win/loss data)

        <strong>EXAMPLE 2 - GOOD INSIGHT:</strong>

        <strong>FINDING:</strong> Integration limitations are a growing concern but not yet a deal-breaker
        <strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
        - 34% of customers mentioned integration challenges
        - But only 8% rated it as top-3 priority issue
        - No correlation with renewal likelihood (r=0.12, p=0.19)
        - However, mentioned by 67% of enterprise customers vs. 21% of mid-market
        <strong>SO WHAT:</strong>
        - Not urgent for current base, but critical for enterprise segment growth
        - Competitor differentiator: Epic has 2x more certified integrations
        - Action: Prioritize top 10 integration requests from enterprise prospects (not all integration requests)
        <strong>CONFIDENCE:</strong> Medium (mixed signals, segment differences suggest complexity)

        <strong>EXAMPLE 3 - GOOD INSIGHT:</strong>

        <strong>FINDING:</strong> UI overhaul may have contributed to NPS decline but isn't the primary driver
        <strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
        - 43% mentioned UI changes, but sentiment is mixed (31% positive, 48% negative, 21% neutral)
        - NPS decline started 2 months before UI launch, continued at same rate after
        - Customers who onboarded after UI launch have same NPS as those before (42 vs. 43)
        - Support tickets about UI peaked in month 1 post-launch, declined to baseline by month 3
        <strong>SO WHAT:</strong>
        - UI was a contributor but not the root cause (support issues are bigger driver)
        - Change management issue: UI changes weren't adequately communicated
        - Action: Improve change management process for future releases, but don't roll back UI
        <strong>CONFIDENCE:</strong> High (temporal analysis, segment comparison, support ticket validation)

        <strong>CONTEXT:</strong>
        You are designing a customer satisfaction survey for TechFlow CRM, a B2B SaaS company providing 
        customer relationship management software to small businesses (10-50 employees). We have 5,000 
        customers and are experiencing declining renewal rates (from 89% to 82% over 6 months). Main 
        competitor (Salesforce) has NPS of 38 vs. our 31. Leadership needs to decide whether to invest 
        $1.5M in customer support expansion or product development. Decision at board meeting July 15th.

        <strong>LENGTH & FORMAT:</strong>
        Generate 15 survey questions with this distribution:
        - 1 NPS question (standard 0-10 format)
        - 8 seven-point Likert scales (very dissatisfied to very satisfied)
        → 3 questions about product usability
        → 3 questions about customer support
        → 2 questions about value for money
        - 4 multiple choice questions (5-6 options each)
        → Most-used features
        → Biggest pain point
        → Competitive consideration
        → Primary business benefit
        - 2 open-ended questions
        → "What ONE improvement would make the biggest difference?"
        → "What do you value most about TechFlow?"
        Must complete in under 6 minutes on mobile.

        <strong>EXAMPLES:</strong>
        Likert format: "How satisfied are you with the ease of creating custom reports?"
        1-Very Dissatisfied | 2-Dissatisfied | 3-Somewhat Dissatisfied | 4-Neutral | 5-Somewhat Satisfied | 6-Satisfied | 7-Very Satisfied

        Multiple choice format: "Which feature do you use most frequently?"
        a) Contact management  b) Email campaigns  c) Sales pipeline  d) Reporting  e) Integrations  f) Other

        <strong>AUDIENCE:</strong>
        Survey respondents are small business owners and office managers (ages 30-55, 60% female, 
        non-technical, extremely busy). Questions must be:
        - Clear and jargon-free (8th grade reading level)
        - Under 50 characters for mobile screens
        - Respectful of their limited time
        - Focused on practical business outcomes, not technical features

        <strong>REQUEST:</strong>
        GENERATE a complete satisfaction survey that:
        1. Identifies whether support or product issues are driving churn
        2. Tests specific hypotheses about renewal decline
        3. Provides clear prioritization for investment decision
        4. Uses completely neutral language (no leading questions)
        5. Follows mobile-first design principles
        6. Includes proper skip logic to reduce respondent burden

        Include response options for all closed-ended questions and brief rationale for key design decisions.
